This is readme for quiz3. For my IA, i have my index.php at the root of my site. This file has the ability to login. I also have a labs page which is located in the root of my labs folder. This page has the option to make a lab entry. My header is dynamic across my entire site because I changed each lab landing page to a php file and included a header php file. I also have a dynamic footer, and codeheader through the same method. Additionally, all sensitive information is behind a password barrier.
